Goal: Master the "Action + Inner/Around + Object" syntax.
Formula: [Operator] + [i or a] + [Object]
Examples: 'diw' (Delete Inner Word), 'ci"' (Change Inside Quotes)

--- SECTION 1: WORDS & SENTENCES ---
(Action: Delete the word 'REPLACE' or the whole sentence.)

1. The quick brown REPLACE jumps over the lazy dog.
   (Use 'diw' inside 'REPLACE' to delete just the word)

2. This is a bad sentence. This is a good sentence.
   (Use 'das' to delete "Around Sentence" – it takes the sentence AND the trailing space)

--- SECTION 2: QUOTES & PARENTHESES ---
(Action: Change the content inside the delimiters.)

3. Constant message = "ORIGINAL_TEXT_HERE"
   (Use 'ci"' to wipe the text inside quotes and enter Insert mode instantly)

4. function_call(parameter_one, parameter_two)
   (Use 'di(' or 'dib' to delete everything inside the parentheses)

--- SECTION 3: TAGS (HTML/XML) ---
(Action: Change the content between tags.)

5. <div>
     <h1>REPLACE_THIS_TITLE</h1>
   </div>
   (Use 'cit' inside the <h1> to change "Inner Tag" content)

--- SECTION 4: THE NESTED CHALLENGE ---
(Action: Delete the entire outer block.)

{
    "level_1": {
        "level_2": "Delete this entire inner curly bracket block"
    }
}
(Put cursor inside level_2 and type 'da{' to delete the brackets and everything inside them)
